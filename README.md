Hi, This is the project repo for my honours project.

To view the code in editor, please download Unity 6000.0.41f

Controls:
Spacebar - change camera from free roam to locked mode
WASD - move camera around

(Playground Only)
Mouse Right click (On person) - view behaviour tree and statistics
Mouse Left click - Place new person

Scoring
The save score button doesn't work in the build, but works In the editor. To view the score in the editor please go to ...\WangYuGrundyHonoursProject\SCORES and open the text file to view scores.

Quick start:
The build includes 2 test scenes and one playground scenes. The test scenes are meant to compare a static behavior tree to one that is genetically programmed. The test makes it so the participants guess which one is which. The playground scene is a scene where you can genetically modify the NPCs in game.
